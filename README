# clominal

I am developing a tool named clominal from 2012.
I will make this tool as a application platform like Emacs or Eclipse recklessly.

'clominal' is implemented by clojure.
There are 2 points why I selected 'clojure'.

First, It is a dialect of Lisp.
Second, it works on JVM.

Speaking only about language specification, Lisp is more powerful than any other not Lisp languages.
(If say further, I think the CL is the most powerful language in other dialects of Lisps.)

If selected Lisp, we can use macro.
Perhaps, in the huge application like IDE, the size of code will become compact. (I expect that. :-)

And then about working on JVM.
CL is the most powerful language in the language specification.
But if you want to make some usefull tools in speedy,
the things what you want is many useful libraries, rather than the powerfull specification language.

It is very easy to use java libraries from clojure.
So, we can use many 3rd party libraries when we make some tools.
